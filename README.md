# Motivation
Mundane python protocols and techniques. There are times when colleagues asked of pretty mundane 'secular' stuffs in coding Python e.g. 'How to swap the x- and y-axis for seaborn plots?'. Often, the way to do it requires some knowledge about the source code (and conundrums of tricks presented on stackoverflow), which I find it pretty annoying to tell it again and again. I hope it helps all of us to save some time.
